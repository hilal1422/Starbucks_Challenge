## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

We want to get an overview overview of the Starbucks population , and how people react to different promotions. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

 We are going trough the Starbucks Capstone Challenge of the Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. we will look at the data simulated by Starbucks customers to look at their spending habbits in relation to different promotions that they have been sent. 

We are interested to answer the following two questions:
Get an overview overview of the Starbucks population
How do people react to different promotions?
How well does a machine learning algorithm cluster the groups of users together? How many number of clusters should Starbucks use ?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

There are three different datasets to look at :
portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json — demographic data for each customer
transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://hilalalhwaiti.medium.com/starbucks-challenge-4cd1426f154e).
